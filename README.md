- Gnss Log Readers is a short repo with MATLAB files that read log files from the RinexOn observation and GNSS Logger applications for SNR and CNO.

# Features
* Use '''runCN0(fileFolder, gnssFile)''' when you want to plot CN0 versus time
* Use '''runCN0andRinex(fileFolder, gnssFile, rinexFile)''' when you want to plot the CN0's of a GNSS log file against the CN0's of a Rinex file
